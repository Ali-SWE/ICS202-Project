The Complexity of Each Method:

1. { addWord(String s) } =>  O(log n) -> Insertion in AVL Tree is O(log n)

2. { findWord(String s) } => O(log n) -> Searching in AVL Tree is O(log n) since AVL trees are always balanced

3. { findSimilar(String s) } => O(n) -> Since they go over all elements in the AVL Tree

4. { saveFile(String fileName) & writeDictionaryInFile(BTNode node,PrintWriter writer) } => O(n) ->
Since they go over all elements in the AVL Tree
